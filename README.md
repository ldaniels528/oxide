Oxide 
=====

### Motivation

The purpose of this project is to create a development platform for small to medium software projects
and proof of concept software projects. The system will offer:
* Rust-inspired language syntax
* integrated dataframes with SQL-like grammar for queries
* integrated REST webservices
* integrated testing framework

Oxide is the spiritual successor to [Lollypop](https://github.com/ldaniels528/lollypop), a multi-paradigm language also
featuring integrated dataframes with SQL-like grammar for queries, but built for the JVM and 
developed in the Scala programming language.

### Project Status

The database server is now available and supports basic CRUD operations via REST for:
* <a href="#create_table">creating tables</a>
* <a href="#drop_table">dropping tables</a>
* <a href="#overwrite_row">insert/overwrite a row by offset</a>
* <a href="#read_row">retrieve a row by offset</a>
* <a href="#delete_row">delete a row by offset</a>
* <a href="#rpc">remote procedure calls</a>

### Development

#### Build the Oxide REPL and Server

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You'll find the executables in `./target/release/`:
* `oxide_repl` is the Oxide REST client / REPL
* `oxide_server` is the Oxide REST Server

#### Run the tests

To run the tests (~ 130 tests at the time of writing):

```bash
cargo test
```

### Getting Started

<a name="create_table"></a>
#### Create a table

The following command will create a new table in the `a.b.stocks` namespace:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
      "columns": [{
          "name": "symbol",
          "column_type": "String(4)",
          "default_value": null
        }, {
          "name": "exchange",
          "column_type": "String(4)",
          "default_value": null
        }, {
          "name": "lastSale",
          "column_type": "Double",
          "default_value": null
        }],
      "indices": [],
      "partitions": []
    }' \
    http://0.0.0.0:8080/a/b/stocks
```

<a name="drop_table"></a>
#### Drop a table

The following command will delete the existing table in the `a.b.stocks` namespace:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/a/b/stocks
```

server response:

```json
1
```

<a name="overwrite_row"></a>
#### Insert/overwrite a row by offset

In this example we insert/overwrite a row into a new or existing table in the `a.b.stocks` namespace:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
      "columns": [{
          "name": "symbol",
          "value": "ABC"
        }, {
          "name": "exchange",
          "value": "NYSE"
        }, {
          "name": "lastSale",
          "value": 56.17
        }],
      "indices": [],
      "partitions": []
    }' \
    http://0.0.0.0:8080/a/b/stocks/100
```

server response:

```json
1
```

<a name="read_row"></a>
#### Retrieve a row by offset

The following command will retrieve the content at offset `100` from the `a.b.stocks` table:

```bash
curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:8080/a/b/stocks/100
```

server response:

```json
{
  "id": 100,
  "columns": [{
      "name": "symbol",
      "value": "ABC"
    }, {
      "name": "exchange",
      "value": "NYSE"
    }, {
      "name": "lastSale",
      "value": 56.17
    }]
}
```

<a name="delete_row"></a>
#### Delete a row by offset

The following command will delete the existing table in the `a.b.stocks` namespace:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://0.0.0.0:8080/a/b/stocks/100
```

server response:

```json
1
```

<a name="rpc"></a>
#### Remote Procedure Calls

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a feature that allows Oxide to evaluate expressions across
remote peers.

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "code": "5 + 5"
         }' \
     http://0.0.0.0:8080/rpc
```

server response:

```json
10.0
```
