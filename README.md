TinyDB (Rust port)
======================

### Motivation

The purpose of this project is evaluate the developer experience offered by
Rust and Go by implementing the [same database engine](https://github.com/ldaniels528/lollypop) in both languages.

You can find the [Go version here](https://github.com/ldaniels528/tinyDB.go).

I'm just getting started but check back from time to time to see the progress.

### Development

TinyDB (Rust) is not yet a working product; however, it is progressing quickly. 

If you'd like to run the tests just to see what's going on:

```bash
cargo test
```
